# Designing-a-Peta-Bytes-Application
system design explanation with pseudo-code and architectural choices for building a Petabyte-scale application

✅ Data Layer: Databricks (Delta Lake)
✅ Application Layer: Salesforce (Customer/Order Journey)
✅ Legacy OSS: Network Inventory / Provisioning System

And handling the following data operations:

Store & retrieve data
Cache expensive computations
Search
Messaging queues
Stream processing
Batch processing

🔄 Data Store & Retrieve Layer (Databases)
Design:
Use Delta Lake on Databricks for:
Versioned, reliable, ACID-compliant storage
Scalability for Petabyte-scale
Schema evolution for legacy OSS systems

🚀 Cache Expensive Operations (Redis)
Use Case: Cache frequent product-pricing queries for Salesforce API

🔍 Search Indexes (ElasticSearch / OpenSearch)
Store logs, customer metadata, order details for quick search
Integrate into Salesforce for dynamic filtering

📬 Async Messaging (Kafka Message Queues)
Decouple Salesforce from OSS with Kafka topics for provisioning, order handling
Example: Salesforce triggers order → Kafka → OSS consumes

🩸 Real-time Stream Processing (Spark Streaming)
Handle telemetry from devices
Enrich and push back insights to Salesforce for dashboards

📚 Batch Processing (Databricks Jobs)
Nightly jobs: churn prediction, usage aggregation
Spark SQL / ML jobs to run analytics at scale

🎯 Application Layer (Salesforce ↔ API ↔ Data Layer)
Salesforce Apex Triggers push data to APIs → Kafka → Databricks
External Services / Named Credentials pull insights (recommendations, predictions) from Databricks

✅ Key Design Decisions
Capability	Solution	Reason
Data Storage	Delta Lake	Petabyte scale, ACID, Schema Evolution
Fast Access	Redis	Sub-millisecond response for frequent queries
Search	ElasticSearch	Keyword, range search, auto-complete
Messaging	Kafka	Decoupled system, back-pressure handling
Stream Processing	Spark Streaming	Real-time insights, anomaly detection
Batch Processing	Databricks Jobs / PySpark	Large-scale, periodic computation
Salesforce Integration	REST APIs / Named Creds	Secure, scalable handshake between layers

💪 Scalability & Future-Readiness
Modular architecture supporting future AI/ML models
Easily extensible to IoT telemetry or GenAI agents
Compliance-ready (GDPR, HIPAA) with Databricks security features
